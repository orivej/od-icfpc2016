Highlights of this repository are:

- `solve-problem` in `solver.lisp` that, given a convex problem, computes its solution;

- `solution-fill-targets` in `solution.lisp` that, given coordinates of the points on the unit square, the list of facets and the index of the stationary facet, computes coordinates of the points after folding the origami;

- `plot-problem` in `plot.lisp` that visualizes problems using gnuplot.
